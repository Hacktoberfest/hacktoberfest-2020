          Hacktoberfest is a great resource for technology companies looking to
          increase participation in their open source projects.
        </p>

        <p>
          Your company can participate by encouraging people to contribute to
          your repositories, organizing community events, or engaging internal
          employees.
        </p>

        <p>
          The rules are slightly different this year. Make sure you classify your 
          repositories with the <code>hacktoberfest</code> topic to qualify your 
          pull requests!
        </p>

        <p>
          Logos from participating companies are displayed on the official
          Hacktoberfest website to showcase your support of open source.

          Our friends at Indeed had a lot of success getting their employees
          involved in Hacktoberfest. Theyâ€™ve
          <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uweScYvtUts&feature=youtu.be">
            talked about this
          </a>
          at DevRelCon and have created a <a href="https://engineering.indeedblog.com/indeed-hacktoberfest-2020/">case study</a> to help your company do the
          same.
