          Given the severe impact that the global pandemic has had on all of our
          communities, we encourage all Hacktoberfest meetups this year to
          happen online. We’re here to help!
        </p>

        <p>
          Organizing a Hacktoberfest meetup in October is a great way to support
          and encourage the open source community.

          Make sure you are up-to-date on the latest participation rules and educate your 
          attendees as well. The rules are slightly different this year. 
          Hacktoberfest is now opt-in for projects. And, contributions will only count 
          towards participation once they have been merged, approved by the maintainer 
          or labelled as <code>hacktoberfest-accepted</code>. You can also reach out to 
          <a href="mailto:hacktoberfestevents@digitalocean.com">

          </a> if you have any questions.
