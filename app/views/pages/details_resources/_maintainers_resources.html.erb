    to issues in your GitHub project that are ready for new contributors to work on.</p>
    <p> <span class="highlight">*</span> Add a CONTRIBUTING.md file with
      contribution guidelines to your repo.</p>
    <p> <span class="highlight">*</span> Choose issues that have a well-defined
      scope and are self-contained.</p>
    <p> <span class="highlight">*</span> Adopt a code of conduct to foster a
