          community, and anyone who is interested in sectioning in.
        </li>
        <li><strong>Quantity is fun, quality is key.</strong> Participating in Hacktoberfest leads to personal growth,
          professional opportunities, and community building. However, it all begins with meaningful contributions to
          open source software.

      <p>Pull requests following the rule change must be to a participating public repository on GitHub, have been

      <p>The pull request must contain commits you made yourself. If a maintainer reports your pull request as spam, 
        it will not be counted toward your participation in Hacktoberfest. If a maintainer reports behavior that’s

      </h2>
      <hr/>
      <p>In line with Hacktoberfest value #2 (Quantity is fun, quality is key), we have provided examples of pull
        requests that we consider to be low-quality contributions (which we discourage).</p>
      <ul>
        <li> Pull requests that are automated (e.g. scripted opening pull requests to remove whitespace/fix
          typos/optimize images).
        </li>
        <li> Pull requests that are disruptive (e.g. taking someone else's branch/commits and making a pull request).
        </li>
        <li> Pull requests that are regarded by a project maintainer as a hindrance vs. helping.</li>
        <li> Something that's clearly an attempt to simply +1 your pull request count for October.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Last but not least, one pull request to fix a typo is fine, but 5 pull requests to remove a stray whitespace is
        not.</p>

      </h2>
      <hr/>
      <ul>
        <li>Spammy pull requests can be given a label that contains the word "invalid" or "spam" to discount them.
          Maintainers are faced with the majority of spam that occurs during Hacktoberfest, and we dislike spam just as
          much as you. If you're a maintainer, please label any spammy pull requests submitted to the repositories you
          maintain as "invalid" or "spam", and close them. Pull requests with this label won't count toward Hacktoberfest.
        </li>
        <li>There's a fourteen-day review window for all pull requests before they count toward completing the challenge.
          Once a participant has submitted four eligible pull requests (ready-to-review, not drafts), the review window
          begins. This period gives maintainers time to identify and label spammy pull requests as invalid. If the pull
          requests are not marked as invalid within that window, they will allow the user to complete the Hacktoberfest
          challenge. If any of the pull requests are labeled as invalid, the user will return to the pending state until
          they have four eligible pull requests, at which point the review period will start again.
        </li>
        <li>Bad repositories will be excluded. In the past, we've seen many repositories that encourage participants to
          make simple pull requests – such as adding their name to a file – to quickly gain a pull request toward
          completing Hacktoberfest. While this may be a learning tool for new contributors, it goes against one of our
          core values for Hacktoberfest. The quality of pull requests is paramount; quantity comes second. These
          repositories do not encourage quality contributions and provide an unfair advantage in completing the
          Hacktoberfest challenge. We've implemented a system to block these repositories, and any pull requests
          submitted to such repositories will not be counted.
