      <p>Attending a meetup is an important and valuable part of Hacktoberfest. This year, we’re keeping the tradition of hacking with others alive by bringing the community together online. This year, we’ve partnered with OrganizerHQ by Major League Hacking (MLH), and Mattermost, to make it easier to organize your meetups online.</p>

      <p>In order to have your online meetup listed on hacktoberfest.digitalocean.com, <strong>you must use the MLH event platform to create your event.</strong></p>

      <p>You can still promote your meetup on Facebook, Eventbrite, Meetup, or any other channel you choose. Simply create your meetup on MLH and paste the link in the event description of your meetup group and instruct participants to RSVP on MLH.</p>

      <p>First time organizing a meetup? Watch the video or continue reading to learn more about online meetups.</p>

      <p>
        We encourage you and your co-organizers to facilitate the workshops! (You got it!) If you’d like extra help, invite open source project owners/maintainers, leaders passionate about open source, and computer science educators who support open source in your community to speak or help with meetup attendees. If there is an open source enthusiast in your community, reach out to them via email or on Twitter. The worst that can happen is they’re not able to attend.
      </p>
      <p>
        You can also review our list of featured speakers who may be able to attend your meetup; simply reach out to them via social media.

        Just because we’re all virtual doesn't mean we can’t take selfies and group photos in video conferences. Encourage meetup participants to share photos on social media using the hashtag #hacktoberfest or #hacktoberfest2020 and tagging @digitalocean. (Please be mindful of photo preferences of attendees.

        Even though you won’t be able to provide something delicious for your community to enjoy, you can still encourage your attendees to come with their own snacks. Your community will be so busy hacking that they might forget to drink water and eat. Remind them to keep their energy up while contributing to open source.
      </p>
      <p>
        Make this clear in your meetup invitation so guests come prepared. Bonus: Include one or two items that add a festive <a href="https://www.pinterest.com/explore/fall-party-foods/">fall/autumn</a> or <a href="https://www.pinterest.com/explore/oktoberfest-party/">Oktoberfest</a> mood.
