  <div class="container">
    <ol class="steps-list">
      <li>Craft an event agenda.</li>
      <li>Set a date:
        Confirm that your preferred venue and any co-organizers, speakers, and
        facilitators are available.</li>
      <li>Promote the event: Invite your community
        to attend. And don't forget to add your event <a href="#form">here</a>.</li>
      <li>Facilitate the event: Create an open,
        inclusive, and welcoming atmosphere.</li>
      <li>Share special moments on social
        media. (Please remember to ask attendees for permission to use their
        photos.)</li>
    </ol>
    <h3 class="title is-3">Who to invite to the meetup</h3>
    <p>Anyone interested in learning about and/or contributing to
      open source.</p>
    <h3 class="title is-3">When's the best time to host your meetup?</h3>
    <p>Preferably the first half of October to give
      participants time to complete four pull requests!</p>
    <h3 class="title is-3">Where to host your event</h3>
    <p>
      An easily accessible, inclusive location with reliable WiFi and a
      comfortable space that is workshop- and live-coding friendly. For
      example:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li> A classroom at a university or code school</li>
      <li> A coworking space</li>
      <li> An incubator/accelerator</li>
      <li> An office of an open source/tech company</li>
      <li> Anywhere that will have you!</li>
    </ul>
    <h3 class="title is-3">Sample agenda</h3>
    <p>
      This is merely a suggestion — feel free to customize it to suit your
      community!
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <span class="pink-highlight">Welcome</span> — Set a welcoming, open, and
        inclusive tone. Thank everyone for attending, tell them about
        yourself, give an overview of the programming, and remind them of the
        <a href="https://do.co/hacktoberconduct" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">code of conduct</a>.
      </li>
      <li><span class="pink-highlight">Intro to
        Hacktoberfest: the celebration, prizes, and instructions</span> — It's
        important to mention the key points of Hacktoberfest. For example: "This is
        all about encouraging meaningful contributions to the open source ecosystem —
        for beginners and veterans alike."</li>
      <li><span class="pink-highlight">Intro to open source</span> —
        See <a href="#resources">Resources</a> section for
        inspiration.</li>
      <li><span class="pink-highlight">Workshop</span> — how to contribute to open source — See <a href="#resources">Resources</a> section for
        inspiration.</li>
      <li><span class="pink-highlight">Demos [optional; before/after hack time]</span> — 3 to 5-minute demos by anyone interested in sharing
        their open source projects.</li>
      <li><span class="pink-highlight">Hack time</span> — Facilitate the formation of groups by interest and hack
        together.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3 class="title is-3">Speakers &amp; facilitators</h3>
    <p>You and your co-organizers are encouraged to facilitate the
      workshops! (You got it!) If you’d like extra help, invite open source project
      owners/maintainers, leaders passionate about open source, and computer science
      educators who support open source in your community to speak or help with
      meetup attendees. If there is an open source enthusiast in your community,
      reach out to them via email or on Twitter! The worst that can happen is
      they’re not able to attend.</p>
    <h3 class="title is-3">Photo sharing</h3>
    <p>Encourage event participants to share photos on social
      media using the hashtag <span class="css-13tjkz1">#hacktoberfest</span>.
      (Please be mindful of photo preferences of attendees — don’t force camera-shy
      individuals into photos!)</p>

    <h3 class="title is-3">Food &amp; drinks</h3>
    <p>Provide something delicious that your community will enjoy!
      Bonus: one or two items that add a festive fall/autumn or Oktoberfest mood.
      Remember to account for food allergies, preferences, and local alcohol
      consumption laws (if alcohol is served).</p>
    <p>If you don't
      plan on serving any food/drinks, that's OK too! Make that clear on your event
      invitation so guests come prepared.</p>
    <h3 class="title is-3">Other fun
      ideas</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>First pull request of the evening to receive [insert prize].</li>
      <li>Raffle off 3-5 prizes to be given away at the end of the evening.</li>
      <li>Wrap up the event by inviting participants to share what they learned/worked on.</li>
    </ul>

    <h4 class="title is-4">What's Hacktoberfest?</h4>
    <p><a href="https://hacktoberfest.digitalocean.com">Hacktoberfest — brought to you by DigitalOcean</a>
      in partnership with DEV — is a month-long celebration of open source software.
      Maintainers are invited to guide would-be contributors towards issues that
      will help move the project forward, and contributors get the opportunity to
      give back to both projects they like and others they've just discovered. No
      contribution is too small — bug fixes and documentation updates are valid ways
      of participating.</p>
    <p>
      Can't make it to this event?
      Hacktoberfest is virtual and open to participants from around the globe. Sign
      up to participate today at https://hacktoberfest.digitalocean.com.
    </p>
    <h4 class="title is-4">Rules and prizes</h4>
    <p>First, sign up on the Hacktoberfest site at
      https://hacktoberfest.digitalocean.com. To qualify for the official limited
      edition Hacktoberfest shirt, you must register and make four pull requests
      between October 1-31. Pull requests can be to any public repo on GitHub, not
      just the ones with issues labeled Hacktoberfest. If a maintainer reports your
      pull request as spam or behavior not in line with the project’s code of
      conduct, you will be ineligible to participate.</p>
    <p>Connect with other Hacktoberfest participants by using
      #hacktoberfest on your social media platform of choice.</p>
