  </h1>

  <h2 class="h2 title is-2"> Event Details</h2>
  <p>
    Hacktoberfest is open to everyone in our global community. Whether you’re a developer, student learning to code, event host, or company of any size, you can help drive growth of open source and make positive contributions to an ever-growing community. All backgrounds and skills levels are encouraged to complete the challenge.
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>Hacktoberfest is open to everyone in our global community!</li>
    <li>Pull requests can be made in any GitHub-hosted repositories/projects.</li>
    <li>Sign up anytime between October 1 and October 31.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2 class="h2 title is-2">Rules</h2>
  <p>
    To qualify for the official limited edition Hacktoberfest shirt, you must register and make four pull requests (PRs) between October 1-31 (in any time zone). PRs can be made to any public repo on GitHub, not only the ones with issues labeled Hacktoberfest. If a maintainer reports your pull request as spam or behavior not in line with the project’s code of conduct, you will be ineligible to participate. This year, the first 50,000 participants who successfully complete the challenge will earn a T-shirt.

        As participants long before we became sponsors, we’re thankful to our friends at
        <a href="https://www.digitalocean.com/">DigitalOcean</a>
        for creating Hacktoberfest. As an advocate of developers and startups, their cloud platform uniquely hits on both simplicity and scalability. And their
        <a href="https://www.digitalocean.com/community">Community platform</a>
        has become a global resource for education on development and DevOps topics, further illustrating that they, too, are stewards of
