        what is happening in https://github.com/education/teachers_pet/commit/be8a8b1ddb3a8ef79a88f53f6bd05649417f0515,
        I notice that we are not stubbing any repo deletion requests - which then
        therefore would mean that these tests aren''t actually sending any API requests.\n\n@PeterDaveHello
        - these tests should be hitting a delete repo endpoint on the GitHub API,
        should they not? Can we rework them so that they do? These tests should fail
        in the case the we comment out the `teachers_pet(:delete_repos)`... block.\n\n/cc

        systems","body":"Introducing switchable type coercion systems for Hashie.
        Follows up on #239.\n\nAdds ''dry-types'' and ''activemodel'' alongside Hashie''s
        builtin coercion system. Basic usage is written up in the README.\n\nFor the
        most part, reading the source should be straight forward. The ''coercion''
        folder under ''extensions'' contains the implementation of the 3 coercion
        systems. The `Hashie::Extensions::Coercion` module was split into two files.
        The file itself contains the interface and common coercion methods, while
        the `Coercion::HashieTypes` class now contains the actual coercion implementation.\n\nThe
        only confusing part is the `CoercionSystemIncludeBuilder` defined under `Hashie::Extensions::Coercion`.
        The purpose of this class is to DRY up the included hooks for `Hashie::Extensions::Coercion`
        and `Hashie::Extensions::Dash::Coercion`. The common includes are defined
        once, and reused in the default `included` method and the `active_model` and
        `dry_types` methods on both the default and Dash coercion classes. The `active_model`
        and `dry_types` methods on `Hashie::Extensions::Coercion` and `Hashie::Extensions::Dash::Coercion`
        both return an anonymous module with an `included` method correctly defined,
        which then is immediately executed because it then included. \n\nExample:
        \n\n``` ruby\nmod = Hashie::Extensions::Coercion.dry_types\n# => <Module:
        xyz>\n\nmod.methods\n#=> [:included]\n\nclass MyHash < Hashie::Hash\n  include
        mod\nend\n#=> Hashie::Extensions::Coercion::ClassMethods, Hashie::Extensions::Coercion::InstanceMethods,
        and Hashie::Extensions::Coercion::DryTypes are all mixed into MyHash\n```\n\nThis
        is 100% backwards compatible and all the tests pass. I did not add any additional
        tests - we should not need many as the new coercion systems are well tested
        in their own repos. We may want to add a few tests though.\n","url":"https://github.com/intridea/hashie/pull/379","createdAt":"2016-10-25T19:59:18Z","labels":{"edges":[{"node":{"name":"new
